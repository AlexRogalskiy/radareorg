We're all pretty friendly, and are hanging on our `Telegram
<https://telegram.me/joinchat/ACR-FkEK2owJSzMUYjt_NQ>`__/`irc
<irc://irc.freenode.net/radare>`__/`RIOT <https://riot.im/app/#/room/#radare:matrix.org>`__/`Matrix <https://matrix.to/#/#radare:matrix.org>`__ channels
(there is a bridge between all of them.). You can also follow us on `twitter <https://twitter.com/radareorg>`__
if you want, or if you're desperate, you can try to email `pancake
<pancake@nopcode.org>`__, the creator of radare2.

If you never touched radare2 before, you can play with our `web interface <http://cloud.rada.re/enyo/>`__,
or :ref:`install it <downloads>` on your system. If you found a bug,
please do `open an issue <https://github.com/radare/radare2>`__ on our github repository.

If you already know radare2, you can spread the love by getting some
`merchandising <http://camisetasfrikis.es/31-radare>`__, but be warned that
people will come to ask you various questions about radare2 if you're wearing your
swag at public events.

If you're a student, you might want to contribute to the project with the
:ref:`Google Summer of Code <gsoc>`.

If you want to give us a few bucks, we're happy to accept your `bitcoins <bitcoin:1R4daREx3gYpYJ87KqWRahzFHVfZMQVBi?message=donation>`__
or `paypal wires <https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=tkNRr_IOdRz3di3HYtbFHfDAIcJMZXEWg0NKvqeuCDvyACoMjweAOndvGfPWQ9Ned_mW7m&country.x=GB&locale.x=GB>`__.

Every year since 2016 (it was the 10th birthday of radaree),
we're all going to the `r2con <http://radare.org/con/>`__,
a small congress held in Barcelona, with workshops, trainings and :ref:`talks <talks>`,
all about radare2. You're of course more than welcome here.
